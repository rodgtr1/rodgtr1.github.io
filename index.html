<p>My name is Travis Rodgers, and this is my personal website. Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p>I am currently a student at <a href="http://block.io">Bloc</a>, studying all things Web development, from JavaScript to CSS to Ruby on Rails, with the goal of transitioning into the vast field of software and web development. I am passionate about learning new things as well as refining those skills I have picked up along the way. My goal is to continue to transition into the field of software and web development, to  continue to learn all that I can in this extensive and ever-changing field, and ultimately...build things!!.</p> 

<p>I also blog regularly at my other site, <a href="http://pursuingthetech.com">Pursuing the Tech</a>, where I am documenting my journey into Web Development. While the blog is broadly about the 'pursuit of tech,' topics can range from coding and technical concepts I am learning along the way, from time management to networking, and from relationships to life in general. My desire is that this will grow into a valuable resource for up and coming web developers.</p>

<p>My current skillset includes HTML/CSS and JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and AngularJS).</p>
  
<p>Aside from all of this, I am married with four children, and live on a thriving three acres in central Virginia.</p>
  
<p>You can find me in a variety of places on the web:</p>
