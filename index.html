<p>My name is Travis Rodgers, and this is my personal website. Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p>I am currently a student at <a href="http://block.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>, studying all things Web development, from JavaScript to Ruby on Rails to object databases like Firebase, with the goal of transitioning into the vast field of software and web development. I am passionate about learning new things as well as perpetually refining those skills I have picked up along the way.</p> 

<p>You can check out my work in the <a href="http://travis.media/projects" target="_blank">Projects</a> page including links to the Github repositories. As for my <a href="http://travis.media/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>, it is currently a means to document my journey into Web Development. While it is broadly about the 'pursuit of tech,' topics can range from coding and technical concepts, from time management to networking, and from relationships to life in general. My desire is that this blog will grow into a valuable resource for up and coming web developers.</p>

<p>My current skillset includes HTML/CSS and JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and AngularJS). Primarily, I enjoy building web applications. I also build websites, make them "pretty," and make them interactive.</p>
  
<p>Aside from all of this, I am married with four children, and live on a thriving three acres in central Virginia.</p>
  
<p>You can find me in a variety of places on the web:</p>
