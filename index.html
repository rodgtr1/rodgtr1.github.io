<p>My name is Travis Rodgers, and this is my personal website. Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p>I live in the "Hill City" of Lynchburg, Virginia and offer services in Web design and development. I'm your go to man if you need a website or web application created, customized, or optimized, and am available for hire via the Contact Form below. I also provide professional mixing and mastering services, create and lease instrumentals, and edit audio and video. A complete list can be referenced in the <a href="http://travis.media/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page and examples found in my <a href="http://travis.media/services" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>, including the links to the production or the <a href="http://github.com/rodgtr1" target="_blank">Github</a> repository itself.</p>

<p>I am passionate about learning new things as well as perpetually refining those skills I have picked up along the way.</p> 

<p>My current coding skillset includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and SPA's such as AngularJS), as well as Ruby on Rails. I also have experience with object oriented databases such as Firebase. Primarily, I enjoy building web applications. I also build websites, make them "pretty," and make them interactive.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, I also offer Audio Mixing and Mastering services, Video Editing services, and create original instrumentals for lease. This has been a hobby of mine since 2003, but has become more of a side business since 2014. Samples of this work can be found in the <a href="http://travis.media/portfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> page and the instrumentals in the <a href="http://travis.media/instrumentals" target="_blank">Instrumentals</a> page.</p>

<p>For audio/video, I mix, master, and produce in Logic Pro, and dabble with Ableton from time to time. For video, its Adobe Premiere all the way.</p>
  
<p>As for my <a href="http://travis.media/blog" target="_blank">Blog</a>, it is currently a means to document my journey into Web Development. While it is broadly about the 'pursuit of tech,' topics can range from coding and technical concepts, to music production, to time management and networking, and just life in general. My desire is that this blog will grow into a valuable resource for up and coming web developers and music producers. This is its current intent, and this may change down the road.</p>
  
<p>Aside from all of this, I am married with four children, and live on a thriving three acres in central Virginia. Life is good.</p>
