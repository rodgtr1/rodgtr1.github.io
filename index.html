<p>My name is Travis Rodgers, and this is my personal website. Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p>I am currently a student at <a href="http://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>, studying all things Web development, from JavaScript to Ruby on Rails to object databases like Firebase, with the goal of transitioning into the vast field of software and web development. I am passionate about learning new things as well as perpetually refining those skills I have picked up along the way.</p> 

<p>You can check out my work in the <a href="http://travis.media/portfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> page including links to the Github repositories.</p>

<p>My current coding skillset includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and AngularJS), as well as Ruby on Rails. Primarily, I enjoy building web applications. I also build websites, make them "pretty," and make them interactive.</p>

<p>I also offer Audio Mixing and Mastering services, Video Editing services, and create original instrumentals for lease. This has been a hobby of mine since 2003, but has become more of a side business since 2014. Samples of this work can also be found in the <a href="http://travis.media/portfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> page and the instrumentals in the <a href="http://travis.media/instrumentals" target="_blank">Instrumentals</a> page.</p>

<p>For audio/video, I mix, master, and produce in Logic Pro, and dabble with Ableton from time to time. For video, its Adobe Premiere all the way.</p>
  
<p>As for my <a href="http://travis.media/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>, it is currently a means to document my journey into Web Development. While it is broadly about the 'pursuit of tech,' topics can range from coding and technical concepts, to music production, to time management and networking, and just life in general. My desire is that this blog will grow into a valuable resource for up and coming web developers and music producers.</p>
  
<p>Aside from all of this, I am married with four children, and live on a thriving three acres in central Virginia.</p>
  
<p>You can find me in a variety of places on the web:</p>
