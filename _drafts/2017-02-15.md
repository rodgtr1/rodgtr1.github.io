For nine weeks I have been digging into front end development at Bloc. 

As a recap, in week 1 we learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, git, etc. Week 2 was a JavaScript blowout. Week 3 we began projects. Since then I have learned a ton and am completely satisfied with my current understanding of front end web development. We created Bloc Jams, a Spotify Clone, using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML/CSS. We then took a quick detour and created a portfolio page using the Jekyll platform (of which this site is also run). We then refactored Bloc Jams using Angular JS, a framework I thoroughly enjoyed and look to work more with in the future. Finally, we created a chat application called Bloc Jams in Angular JS, using Firebase as a database. 

What a thrill its been. 

Today I had my second assessment/evaluation. As you recall, I did not pass my first (by half a point), yet am thankful for the chance to refine those weaknesses. Well today I had my second and I passed!

Going into this second assessment I was more comfortable and confident. I realized that, based on the first, if I did not pass then it did not mean I was not apt to be a web developer, but that I just needed to tidy up some fuzzy areas. Fortunately, I knew almost all of the answers and was thankful to pass and move on to Module 3. 

What is Module 3? The Back End!!! 

Time to  jump into Ruby, Rails.....Ruby on Rails!

My timeline says I am 38% complete. Let's do this!
