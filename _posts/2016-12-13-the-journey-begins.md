So yesterday, December 12, 2016, I began what will be an intense, six month, 20+ hour a week Web Developer course with <a href="https://www.bloc.io/" target="_blank">Bloc</a>.

Add to this my full time job, a fairly big family (with four children all under 8), along with a number of other duties/delights, and we have the overall purpose of this blog: To document this journey and all it entails, from Course Commencement to Career Change and all things in-between.

Hopefully it will serve as an encouragement to those looking to take a step in this direction or those already standing in it.

Feel free to follow the blog. Also look for me on Twitter atÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/pursuingthetech" target="_blank">@pursuingthetech</a>

And...oh yeah...Hello World!
