There truly are some very disgruntled coding bootcamp grads out there. And there seems to be a trend found in most that actually account for their dissatisfaction.

### An Initial Misunderstanding

This trend includes the idea that bootcamps are supposed to teach you the skills for a certain profession AND THEN stick you in a job when you are finished. Yes I am aware of the job guarantees, however I think this overall mindset misses the purpose of the bootcamp itself.

A couple of notable points:

<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Coding bootcamps do NOT make you web/software development masters. They instead give you a solid footing in the door. This door, when opened, THEN presents to you a world of opportunity, opportunities that you have to actively pursue both by networking and continuing to learn. In my current bootcamp experience I am coming to grips with how vast this field actually is, and this can actually be a good thing! So will I actively pursue this opportunity or will I look for someone to do it for me.
</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
  Bootcamps are MAINLY about the student and the mentor. Why do I say this? Anyone with dedication and perseverance can learn this same material for free online. In fact, there are MANY that are actively doing so. In addition, India, China, etc. are filled with people who can do this work better than you, for much cheaper. Thus, what makes their expertise different from yours? Well, in terms of content learned, nothing. In terms of personal time spent with a mentor, everything.
</li>
</ul>

### The Bottom Line

Given the above points, here is the Bottom Line:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Bootcamps equip you on a fundamental level with the ability to enter into and pursue this given field within a relatively quick time frame. It is your duty to pursue it and your future career plans relentlessly via networking, continuing to learn, etc. This "pursuit" comes with any type of education, including a four year college degree.

### Wait A Minute...

So you may be wondering: "Who is this guy, still in a bootcamp himself, that is giving &#8220;advice&#8221; to me? Wait until he begins the struggle to find a job."

Well here is my answer: It may be a struggle. It may not be easy. But I went into this knowing that it is <b>my duty</b> to be actively pursuing the end goal, a job in this vast field. The material is there, I will learn it. In addition, I understand that the completion of this course is just the tip of the iceberg, yet it gives me the head start that I would have struggled at obtaining left to my own schedule.

To that I am thankful and highly optimistic.</span>

So stop blaming the bootcamp. Step away from your smoking keyboard and get out there. The world is a big place.
